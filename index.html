    <h1>Three things to do over the holiday</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Spider-man: Homecoming</h3>
        <img src="https:bit.ly/spiderman_homecoming1" height="200" alt="Spider man">
        <p>This is probably one of Marvel's best movies. It's action packed and one you should definitely check out.<a href="http://imax.or.ke/movies/180">learn more</a> </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Transformers: The Last Knight</h3>
        <img src="http://bit.ly/transformers_the_last" height="200" alt="Optimus Prime">
        <p>This will definitely get those of you who have missed the deep voice of Optimus Prime. It's not the best transformers movie, but it's not terrible either</p>

          <li>
            <h3>Sleep</h3>
            <img src="https://bit.ly/3cGfJRQ"height="200"alt="Too sleepy">
            <P>This list would not be complete without adding sleep. While some of you may be tempted to think it's a waste of time for such a short holiday, I highly advice against it. In fact, if there's one thing you should do, its to sleep!</P>
